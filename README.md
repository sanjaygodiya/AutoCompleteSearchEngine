## AutoCompleteSearchEngine

Most of the enterprise applications don't have auto complete and auto suggest feature in search boxes. The search box doesn't suggest, and complete user queries and users must key-in the complete query and then search for the results. This tool will enable search box to suggest users some frequently searched queries based on the user’s initial keywords and quickly complete the queries to search. The tool can scan the knowledge base and define the search priority words which will be used in producing  search suggestions. The suggestions can be tuned as per client’s business domain, different industries or locales. The tool can also save the user queries which will be helpful to understand users search trends and improve search suggestions. This tool can be integrated with any application which supports JavaScript, jQuery and CSS.
